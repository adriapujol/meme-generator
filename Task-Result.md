# Task Result

### [demo](https://memegenerator2022.netlify.app/)

## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- JavaScript / React
- SASS

I mainly used React because it allows for richer interfaces and the use of hooks to control the flow and state of the page. And SASS for the mixins, variables and allowed nesting.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project: 

[react-html5-camera-photo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-html5-camera-photo) | For controling the camera from the device.

[use-react-screenshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-react-screenshot) and [html2canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html2canvas) | For downloading the image with the caption.

## Installation / Run

To run the project locally, enter the following in the command line / bash:

```console
$ git clone <linktorepository>
$ cd <repositoryname>
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
